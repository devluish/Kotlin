# Kotlin Android Studies

This repository is dedicated to my studies and experiments with **Kotlin** and **Android development**.

Here I explore:
- Core Kotlin concepts (syntax, OOP, collections, functions, coroutines, etc.)
- Android fundamentals (Activities, Fragments, Views, Navigation)
- Modern Android tools (ViewModel, LiveData/StateFlow, Jetpack components)
- API integration, clean architecture, and good development practices

> The goal of this repo is to track my evolution as a mobile developer and build a solid foundation for real Android applications.

## Structure

- `basics/` – Kotlin language practice
- `android-fundamentals/` – core Android components
- `projects/` – small apps, tests and feature prototypes

## How to run

1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Sync Gradle.
3. Run on an emulator or physical device.

Feel free to explore, comment, and follow my progress. 🚀
